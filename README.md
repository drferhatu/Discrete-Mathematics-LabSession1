## Advanced Problems (Challenging Assignments)

The problems in this section are more focused on developing logic and mathematical reasoning skills, and they cover more advanced topics.

1.  Write a function that determines if a positive integer is **prime**.

2.  Write a function that lists **all prime numbers** less than or equal to a given positive integer.

3.  Use a loop and the function above to determine whether **$2^p - 1$** is prime for each prime number $p$ not exceeding 100.

4.  Show (test with code) that **$n^2 + n + 41$** is prime for all integers $n$ with $0 \le n \le 39$. But also show that it is not prime when $n=40$.

5.  Find **10 different prime numbers**, each with 100 digits. (This task may require online research or special libraries.)

6.  Find all **pseudoprimes** to the base 2. That is, find composite integers $n$ such that **$2^{n-1} \equiv 1 \pmod n$**, where $n$ does not exceed 10000.
